# Secrect Hitler Addons

3D printed addons to enhance the secret hitler board game

## Draw and Discard Pile

The draw and discard pile aren't done by myself. I use the _Secret Hitler Policy Draw and Discard Piles_ by _philipl_ on Thingiverse. They need to be scaled by **142%** in order to fit with the board game. <br>
There is a remixed version of these in this repository. The drawpile was modified for easier drawing of cards and they are already scaled up.

## Dead Player Marker

The dead player marker is based on a remixed deage from Thingiverse. The remixed version is in this repository.

## Skipped Policies Marker

This marker is based on a [besign by YerrytheYanitor](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2122921). The remixed version is in this repository.

## President/Cancellor Paper Card Holder

This addon is needed for the chinese clone of the game. It stiffens the paper markers to be more usable.
